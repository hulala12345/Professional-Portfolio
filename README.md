# Professional Portfolio

This repository contains a simple personal portfolio website. The site is a static HTML page with a fixed navigation bar, profile section, project cards, skill tag cloud, and contact links. It includes placeholders for a profile picture and a downloadable resume.

## Customizing

1. Replace `assets/img/profile.jpg` with your own profile picture.
2. Replace `assets/pdf/resume.pdf` with your own resume (ensure sensitive data such as salary information is removed first).
3. Update the content in `index.html` with your personal introduction, projects, skills, and social media links.

The site is responsive and should look good on both desktop and mobile devices.

To view the website, open `index.html` in a web browser.
